# All-Java-Question-365Day
practice
This is My Every day Task where Start my day.

A few thoughts that I always remind myself about when I lose motivation:

think back, why you even started with leetcode and doing coding challenges? What is your goal? Your dream?
it's normal to have bad days! You are just a human, not a robot. Whenever I have a bad day where I can't even think of a solution for an easy question I try to keep in mind that there will be better days again in the future. No idea if tomorrow, in a week or a month but there will be for sure a change for the better. The most important thing is just that you don't give up when times get tough!!!
practicing coding challenges on leetcode is an investment in yourself to broaden your technical knowledge and skills! No matter how many rejections from job interviews you get - doing the coding challenges here will always make you a better engineer at some point if you don't give up
